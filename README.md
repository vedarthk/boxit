# boxit
This utility will help many photographers/videographers to upload files directly from SD card to Dropbox thus saving a lot of disk space on you Mac book pro.

The question is, how does this save hard disk space ?
Answer is, enable selective sync in Dropbox preferences and ignore the big directory with all of your photographs and videos

Usage:
```
$ boxit upload /Volumes/SDCard/DCIM/blah/ /Photos/2017/
```

above command will upload all the files from `/Volumes/SDCard/DCIM/blah/` to Dropbox in `/Photos/2017/`

### TODO
Add more to readme and improve user expirience of the utility
